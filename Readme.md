To build a stopwatch web application, using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I used HTML to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting,pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, we can accurately measure and record times intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, I created an interactive and userfriendly web application.
